## Credits

- The [Hex Casting](https://github.com/gamma-delta/HexMod) mod, of course.
- The [Spirit Walker](https://github.com/BasiqueEvangelist/SpiritWalker) mod. Basic clientside "freecam" functionality
  of Astral Projection is greatly inspired by their implementation, and uses some of their code as a reference.
- The [Perspective](https://github.com/MCLegoMan/Perspective) mod. Astral Projection shader implementation here is
  loosely based on their "grayscale" super secret setting implementation.
- The [Extensible Enums](https://github.com/Fuzss/extensibleenums) library. Fabric version of the mod uses it to add the
  custom enchantment target to the Featherweave Cloak.
- Base Minecraft. The mod uses two sounds from
  it, [Soulsand Valley Whisper 1](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Ambience) for astral ambience (slightly modified to
  loop better) and [Ender Eye Death 2](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Eye_of_ender_sounds) for projection
  end.
- Developers of the [HexDoc template](https://github.com/hexdoc-dev/hexdoc-hexcasting-template) for Hex Casting addons.
